Part 1:
i should be greater than capacity.
i > CAPACITY

Part 2:
The min_val variable should be equal to arr[0], not 0.
max_i should also be replaced with min_i.

Part 3:
CAPACITY should be replaced with CAPACITY - 1
The if bracket is not properly closed


Part 4:
The error that was discovered was in the addUp function
Instead of adding up the values of the array, the function was adding
up the indices of each value.
In line 87, i should be replaced with arr[i]


Part 5:
arr[i] should be replaced with just i
